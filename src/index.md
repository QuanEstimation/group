## **QuanEstimation Group**

Hello! Welcome to the home page of QuanEstimation group. We focus on the study of quantum technology and quantum information theory. 

## **Research Interests**

# Quantum Metrology & Control

(1) Quantum phase estimations, including single and multiple phase estimations in optical interferometers.
(2) Parameter estimations in atomic interferometers, such as Bose-Einstein condensate.
(3) Controlled schemes to improve the precision of parameter estimations in various systems. 

# Foundations of quantum mechanics
(1) Quantum speed limits. ​​ 

# Quantum Information Theory
(1) Quantum correlation, including the criteria, witness and the dynamical behavior of entanglement and quantum discord.
(2) Spin squeezing.
