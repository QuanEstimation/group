QuanEstimation is a comprehensive toolbox for computation and scheme design in quantum parameter estimation. We are committed to developing this tool constantly 
and invoking new features. 

### **Quantum Metrology and Control**

- Quantum phase estimations, including single and multiple phase estimations in optical interferometers.

- Parameter estimations in atomic interferometers, such as Bose-Einstein condensate.

- Controlled schemes to improve the precision of parameter estimations in various systems. 

### **Foundations of Quantum Mechanics**

- Quantum speed limits. ​​ 

- Quantum correlation, including the criteria, witness, and the dynamical behavior of entanglement and quantum discord.

- Spin squeezing.
