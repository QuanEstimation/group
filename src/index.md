QuanEstimation is a comprehensive toolbox for computation and scheme design in quantum parameter estimation. We are committed to 


### **Quantum Metrology and Control**

(1) Quantum phase estimations, including single and multiple phase estimations in optical interferometers.

(2) Parameter estimations in atomic interferometers, such as Bose-Einstein condensate.

(3) Controlled schemes to improve the precision of parameter estimations in various systems. 

### **Foundations of Quantum Mechanics**

(1) Quantum speed limits. ​​ 

(2) Quantum correlation, including the criteria, witness, and the dynamical behavior of entanglement and quantum discord.

(3) Spin squeezing.
